Monopoly
=======
The project "Monopoly" was part of our second semester at the [Hochschule Bremen](http://www.hs-bremen.de/) in Media Computer Science (Medieninformatik).
The goal was to have a working program, written in Java, with error-handling, file writing/-reading, <span titel="Graphical User Interface">GUI</span> and network communication. We choose to write a game that's based on the original Monopoly.

The source needs to be compiled via javac.
* The [master](https://github.com/Eyenseo/Monopoly/tree/master) branch is in the state the project was rated.
* The [MilestoneThree](https://github.com/Eyenseo/Monopoly/tree/MilestoneThree) branch will be extended with the implemented network functionality.
The sources of the [Client](https://github.com/Eyenseo/Monopoly/tree/MilestoneThree/Monopoly/Client) and [Server](https://github.com/Eyenseo/Monopoly/tree/MilestoneThree/Monopoly/Server) are depending on the classes in [Shared](https://github.com/Eyenseo/Monopoly/tree/MilestoneThree/Monopoly/Shared) - make sure to setup the building environment that way.
